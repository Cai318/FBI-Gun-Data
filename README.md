# Investigate A Dataset: FBI Gun Data  
*By Cai318*

## Introduction
Following the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act that was mandated in 1993, the FBI launched the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) on November 30, 1998. NICS is used by Federal Firearms Licensees (FFL) to determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms or explosives. Prior to making a sale, FFL's or other designated agencies use the NICS to ensure that each customer does not have a criminal record. The gun data that I will be exploring is provided by the NICS. I will also be exploring 2016 Census data that was retrieved from Census.gov. 

I will be analyzing and exploring the data to answer these 3 questions:

- Question 1: What 2016 Census data trends closely with 2016 FBI gun data?
- Question 2: What type of gun has the most background checks performed?
- Question 3: What US State performs the most background checks on the gun type answer from question 2?
